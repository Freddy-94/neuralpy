# neuralpy

A neural network model written in python based on Michael Nielsen's neural networks and deep learning book.
This package provides a simple yet powerful fully-connected multilayer neural network. Since, this is a multilayer feedforward neural network, it is a universal approximator (Hornik, Stinchcombe and White, 1989).
 It can be used for a wide range of applications from image processing to time series prediction.
