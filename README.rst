|neuralpy| is a neural network model written in python based on Michael Nielsen's neural networks and deep learning book.
This package provides a simple yet powerful fully-connected multilayer neural network. Since, this is a multilayer feedforward neural network, it is a universal approximator (Hornik, Stinchcombe and White, 1989). Neural Networks can be used for a wide range of applications from image processing to time series prediction.

The documentation is unfinished but you can take a look on `PyPI
