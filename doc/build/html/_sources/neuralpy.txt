|neuralpy|
--------

|neuralpy| is the original neural network package that features a simple yet powerful tool
for creating neural network models while avoiding all math. All you have to do is focus on the data. Get started
with simple examples and interface descriptions.

.. note::
    |neuralpy| has been succeeded by |neuralpy2| which has a similar interface but is much more extensible and modular.
