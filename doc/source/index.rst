Welcome to neuralpy's documentation!
************************************
This page desribes how to get set up with |neuralpy| and how to start using it.
We always need help! Contribute on `Github <https://github.com/jon--lee/neuralpy.git>`_!

|neuralpy2| is the most intuitive neural network model. |neuralpy2| has succeeded |neuralpy| as the standard for neural network models.
Although |neuralpy| is still supported, we highly recommend you switch over to |neuralpy2|.

The newest package features:

* simple processes for loading, training, and testing data
* variable input and output sizes.
* flexibility with various network structures, activation/output functions, and layer connectivity.
* graphical cost and epoch surveillance through |matplotlib|.
* variable mini-batch sizes for stochastic gradient descent.
* abstraction and modularization of backpropagation.
* extensibility for developers to add their own features, layer types and activation functions.
